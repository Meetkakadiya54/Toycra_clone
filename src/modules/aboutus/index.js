                    <p className="my-10">At Toycra, we take playing very, very seriously. So seriously, that every one of our toys and games has to pass these litmus test questions: Can a child play with this AND learn from this? Is this sustainable, reusable and full of educational utility? Is this different from the local, frail toys/games of cheap quality that are so easily available and so easily trashable? If a toy/game or book positively passes this test, you will definitely find it on this website. With our selection of toys and games, playtime turns into a creative, open-ended experience that contributes to the wholesome growth of the child</p>
                    <p className="my-10">For the last 8 years, we have been carefully selecting the best, most unique toys and games from all corners of the world.
